title: "Creating a customer portal for changing KYC information"
role: "Backend developer"
description: "The project consisted of implementation of a customer portal which shall be used for viewing and updating 
the customer information. According to the laws of AML (anti-money laundering), the customer information within a 
brokerage firm should always be up-to-date, that is \"know your customer\" (KYC). In this regard, it should also be 
possible for an administrator to accept new changes edited by the customer. The project therefore constituted two 
parts, namely a system for the customers as well as a system for administrators."
