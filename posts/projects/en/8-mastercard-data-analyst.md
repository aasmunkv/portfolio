title: "Responsible for data quality during user migration"
role: "Data Analyst"
description: "Since August 2024, I was involved in a large-scale migration project at Mastercard, initially working as a data analyst responsible for ensuring accurate user migration from a legacy system to a new platform by developing Python- and Excel-based solutions for large-scale data processing, validation, and access management. From May 2025, I joined a transition-phase team with deep system expertise, providing second-line support and resolving a significant backlog of access issues for users affected by the migration, where my understanding of both technical systems and business processes made me a key resource. During this phase, I also took on an informal leadership role by training customer support staff and onboarding new team members, contributing significantly to project stabilization and progress."
