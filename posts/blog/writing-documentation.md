extremely important for future maintenance?"

When talking to co-developers about the importance of regularly writing and updating the documentation during a 
development process (and not just afterwards) there is a consensus on the topic. However, shockingly many simultaneously 
have strenuous thoughts when it comes writing the documentation themselves! Why? I think much of the reason behind
this lies in the fact that software developers became developers mainly for one simple reason; writing code and 
getting it to run properly.

Writing documentation for future maintenance and development is important. However, there is a fine balance between
documentation and implementation. If you focus too much on writing good documentation when developing a new system, the
result is often an inefficient process. On the other hand, if you focus too much on getting the system done as quickly
as possible it is very easy to fall into the trap of getting an undocumented system, where it is difficult for both you
and other developers to continue with maintenance and development on a later stage.

So, how do you write documentation in the best and most efficient way possible, without it ruining your development 
flow? My experience is that it is useful to write a small piece of documentation every time I implement a new piece of 
logic to my system. For instance, let's say I have written a new method within a class inside my Java application. Then,
I usually add a docstring to the method with a two-sentence remark explaining the main purpose of the functionality.
After this has been added I keep on developing other parts of my application. I mainly do this for my own sake, as I 
probably will have to read the code in the near or distant future and I really appreciate that my younger self thought 
of me during the development process. Whenever the entire application is finished I turn to my documentation (often 
being a `README.md` file) and try to
write a concise and structure summary of the entire project, where I am able to turn to my docstrings for guidance.

Another useful aspect of writing documentation during (and not after) development is that it may be extremely valuable
to write documentation with a fresh *this is new to me* mindset. More often than not I wind up working on projects where
I have to learn at least one new concept that I have never been exposed to before. Then I find it really useful to 
write a small piece of documentation whenever I read up on the topic. When writing this documentation as a newbie it is
easy to put myself in a position of being a person not knowing the topic (since I am that person), and it is therefore 
easy to write a documentation on the correct level of knowledge.

Moreover, my development process consists of another piece of helpful documentation which I frequently use from start 
to finish, namely a todo list containing a descriptive explanation of what I need to do to bring home the entire project 
at hand. I try to keep it as efficient as possible, so this is usually written inside a `README.md` file at the root 
folder of my project and consists of two lists, namely *TODOs* and *DONEs*. Whenever I have fresh thoughts on what the 
application needs for it to be completed I add a new entry in the todo list, and when a todo is done I move it into the 
done section. This helps me to perform a structured workflow, as well as not forgetting important parts of the project 
development. 

Furthermore, I believe that there is one last piece of documentation we have not yet discussed. Whenever having my last
day of work before a vacation, or sometimes the last hour on fridays, I find it useful to write down where I left off. 
I also write down exactly what I should start working on when I return. By integrating this process into my daily 
life I spare myself of the struggle of getting back to work after some time off, where I often sit for an hour or two 
just searching for the place where I left off.
