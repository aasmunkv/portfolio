My background as a developer began years ago when I decided to become a student at the institute for mathematics at the
University of Oslo. I completed my first course in programming first semester, where I learned Python. I enjoyed
hustling with programming in addition to studying mathematics, and during my years as a student I learned the basics
in Python, Java, C++, MatLab, etc. Thus, I obtained an okay foundation for becoming a developer but focused mainly on
mathematics as I love the pure logic of that field. Moreover, my knowledge of programming was at this point only used
as a tool in my mathematics.

My professional career as a developer began after the university, in 2021, when I was thrown into a job as a backend
developer. My initial thought was that backend development was more elegant than frontend, since it had no focus on
visual design but rather focused on the pure logical aspects of a system. This was a bit narrow-minded, and based on 
lack of intelligence on the area. It appeared to be necessary to learn alot of design patterns and structure theory in 
order to master being a backend developer. I slowly became fond of making a 'perfect' backend system with neat 
documentation, for other developers to read and build upon.

When I began as backender at my first job I remember thinking that it was important to ask the dumb questions early on
to increase my base of knowledge as rapidly as possible. Since I was new in the game my initial thought was something
similar to *if I am not able to show my employer that I can do this, I will get fired*. Luckily, my employer had an
understanding that I came from mathematics and not informatics, and so the experience was quite nice. I especially 
remember one specific question on my first day of work. After my boss talked to me about an API and its endpoints, I 
asked him; *what's an endpoint?* The reason for remembering this specific question is that I think it underlines just 
how little I knew about being a backend developer when I started. Even though I could use a couple of programming 
languages to solve my own mathematically based problems, I had no idea how to make it as a backend developer!
