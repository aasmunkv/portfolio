                    <p>
                        I am currently working as a backend developer in a consultant firm called Omegapoint Norway, located
                        in Oslo, Norway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a masters degree in computation science, with high focus on applied mathematics, from the
                        University of Oslo. The thesis I wrote was about how to approximation solutions to a specific class
                        of partial differential equations by using machine learning models as a tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am fond of collaboration in teams, as well as independent work whenever necessary. The combination
                        of experiences within applied mathematics and informatics has made me passionate about robust code
                        with a focus on high efficiency. In my studies, I have become well acquainted with high-level
                        languages such as Python, C/C++, Java etc. through the development of machine learning models.
                        Through my work as a backend developer I have acquired a strong understanding of building databases
                        and APIs, where I have primarily used the languages Java/Kotlin and Javascript/Typescript, and I
                        have become well acquainted with tools/frameworks such as NodeJS, NextJS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL,
                        Spring Boot, Knex, Prisma and Swagger.
