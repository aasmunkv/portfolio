How to best approach a frontend problem when being a backend developer? The short answer to this question is 
*I do not know*, and I really don't think it exists *one* unique solution to this. It all depends on the degree of 
frontend exposure during previous projects.

I feel like the above image describes the differences between frontend and backend quite well. Since I always have been
developing 'behind the scenes' systems, I have rarely been considerate about how my systems would look like from a
non-developer point of view. As long as the frontend developers are able to integrate up against the backend system in
a neat way, and as long as they always get the correct data and response, my job is done! I had to reset this way of 
thinking when developing this portfolio, since I now need to consider the web page design. I have always been bad at 
visual design, so this has been quite a journey!

This article was merely ment to be a short introductory blog post, and I will look into writing a post later on focusing 
on the technical aspects of how to write your own portfolio (or at least how I wrote mine).
